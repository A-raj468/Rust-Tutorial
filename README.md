# Rust Tutorial

Welcome to the Rust Tutorial â€“ your guide to learning Rust from scratch. This tutorial is a continual work-in-progress, evolving alongside my own journey into Rust programming. My aim is to create a concise and helpful resource for beginners looking to dive into Rust programming. ðŸš€ I primarily use the `cargo` tool for building and running code (though you can also use `rustc` directly to compile files).

## Getting Started

Begin your Rust journey by cloning the [project repository](https://github.com/A-raj468/Rust-Tutorial).

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/A-raj468/Rust-Tutorial.git
```

Once cloned, navigate into the project directory:

```console
$ cd Rust-Tutorial
```

## Build and Run

Move to the desired tutorial (e.g., `04_data_types`) and compile using the `cargo build` command:

```console
$ cd 04_data_types
$ cargo build
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.22s
```

To execute the built binary, use:

```console
$ ./target/debug/data_types
Int32: -2
Unsigned Int: 3
Float: 0.12323
Boolean: true
Character: ;
Tuple: (2, -123.988, false, ')
```

To compile and run the file in one go, employ the `cargo run` command:

```console
$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.21s
     Running `target/debug/data_types`
Int32: -2
Unsigned Int: 3
Float: 0.12323
Boolean: true
Character: ;
Tuple: (2, -123.988, false, ')
```

## Using `rustc` to Compile and Run

For those who prefer using `rustc` directly, compile the file using:

```console
$ rustc <src_file_path>
```

To run the compiled executable, use:

```console
$ <executable_path>
```
